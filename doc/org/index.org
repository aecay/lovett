* Lovett in a nutshell

- about the name
- target audience = advanced technical users and python programmers (initially)

** Development goals

Lovett is developed with the following goals in mind:

1. Primary goals
   - Provide a fast corpus query engine, and a new query language on top of it
   - Provide a usable system for automated corpus revision
2. Secondary goals
   - Provide a replacement for CorpusSearchâ€™s coding query feature
   - Connect this facility with tools for data analysis and visualization in python and R via the Jupyter project
3. Tertiary goals
   - Provide an environment for the design of corpus-based teaching and learning programs

It is anticipated that Lovett will interact with the Annotald tool, and efforts to create a Javascript-based ecosystem for the representation, manipulation, and editing of treebanks.
