#+title: Lovett’s query language

* Introduction

- need for an abstract representation of queries: compatibility with 2 search engines
- use of python syntax enabling automation of query building
  - operator overloading

** Comparison with CorpusSearch

- 2-place predicates vs. builiding of structural queries

* Search functions

** Node-level matches

** Wrappers

** Boolean combinators

* Open questions

** Coindexation

Can’t separately reference the root as in (CS):

IP idoms X AND
IP idoms Y AND
X sameindex Y

For cs sameinstance will ensure that X and Y are sisters – but we don’t have a good way to do this.
